        This package provides a collection of utilities for working with Excel
        files. Since these utilities may require either or both of the xlrd
        and xlwt packages, they are collected together here, separate from either
        package.
        
        Currently available are:
        
        **xlutils.copy**
          Tools for copying xlrd.Book objects to xlwt.Workbook objects.
        
        **xlutils.display**
          Utility functions for displaying information about xlrd-related
          objects in a user-friendly and safe fashion.
        
        **xlutils.filter**
          A mini framework for splitting and filtering Excel files into new
          Excel files.  
        
        **xlutils.margins**
          Tools for finding how much of an Excel file contains useful data.
